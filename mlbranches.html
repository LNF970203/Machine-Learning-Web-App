        <H3>Supervised Learning</H3>
        <p>Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into the model, it adjusts its weights until the model has been fitted appropriately, which occurs as part of the cross validation process. Supervised learning helps organizations solve for a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox.</p>

        <H3>Unsupervised Learning</H3>
        <p>Unsupervised learning models are utilized for three main tasksâ€”clustering, association, and dimensionality reduction. Below we will define each learning method and highlight common algorithms and approaches to conduct them effectively.</p>
        <p>Clustering is a data mining technique which groups unlabeled data based on their similarities or differences. Clustering algorithms are used to process raw, unclassified data objects into groups represented by structures or patterns in the information. Clustering algorithms can be categorized into a few types, specifically exclusive, overlapping, hierarchical, and probabilistic.</p>

        <H3>Reinforcement Learning</H3>
        <p>Reinforcement learning is a machine learning training method based on rewarding desired behaviors and/or punishing undesired ones. In general, a reinforcement learning agent is able to perceive and interpret its environment, take actions and learn through trial and error.</p>
