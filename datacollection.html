        <p>Any software developer at any given moment faces a situation when the task they need to solve contains multiple conditions and branches, and the addition of one more input parameter can mean a total rebuild of the whole solution. Or, you might find yourself in a situation where you have considered all the available options, having checked all the pros and cons, and you realize that there is no way you can solve the problem without using magic. You wish you could take your magic wand and say “I wish…” and get a solution capable of making the right decisions and even adjusting for new data. And taking it even further, it would be nice if the system could teach itself. Sounds like a fairytale and a fairytale it was, until recently. One of these non-trivial tasks is image recognition: objects, animals, images of internal human organs, faces, or even space objects. Any of those categories contains an endless amount of variations.</p>
